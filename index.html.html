          Many maples have bright autumn foliage, and many countries have
          leaf-watching traditions. The sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is the
          primary contributor to fall "foliage season" in
          <span class="Region"> North America</span>, particularly in
          <span class="Region">Central Ontario</span>,
          <span class="Region">Quebec</span>, and
          <span class="Region">northern New England</span>, New York, Wisconsin,
          and Michigan. In <span class="Region">Japan</span>, the custom of
          viewing the changing colour of maples in the autumn is called
          momijigari. Nikko and Kyoto are particularly favoured destinations for
          this activity. In <span class="Region">Korea</span>, the same viewing
          activity is called danpung-nori and the Seoraksan and Naejang-san
          mountains are among the best-known destinations.
